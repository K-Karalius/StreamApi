### Short description

First, the application gets data from the URL and then you hava the ability to:
* Sort any column by ascending or descending order
* Filter any column by text input
* Set names and surnames to uppercase or lower case
* Create a [map](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Map.html) where the key corresponds to the last 3 digits of the IP address, and then print the map to the `output.txt`
